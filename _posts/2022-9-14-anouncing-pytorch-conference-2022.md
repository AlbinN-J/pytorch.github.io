We are excited to announce that the PyTorch Conference returns in-person as a satellite event to [NeurlPS](https://l.workplace.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnips.cc%2F&h=AT3cdRwSEhyuNXpH2ptWjk-KxMxcceaYeTfflT6PEezDQ_zeUxRv1gjX7GhTQBgvZxFAR0wlSBwuhpipdMjUknMnhY5oJ5C4HjLNO40-12UnoeYALriwrvdxGfgigo8KYlWu_gRIQwlO-2r0wTnNft0whoSaOdVAxw&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT3z6QRLu8Uw48lKQ_P6FFq7ncHfjsfI16OGZvWO9kALatCY4sZcMjNzR7a4OiOG25RKVHpDX0TGutZHyM_R8Kl2s71Y3DEbq5QccmUVaSzCbcMUSc5Ms2zXHoeGxUlw1XirihAydPsX4Y1OmF6GRjqH8YFTNTFQRN3I8j2SFhR8LEUDxDmfnZ8Q7c2hXi0HeGc) (Neural Information Processing Systems) in New Orleans on Dec. 2nd.

We changed the name from PyTorch Developer Day to PyTorch Conference to encompass the entire PyTorch Community. This conference will bring together leading researchers and developers from the Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) communities to join a multiple set of talks and a poster session; covering new software releases on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), use cases in academia and industry and production trends in ML/DL.
